# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

To visualize campaign outcomes in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

Using data from Louise's Kickstarter campaigns we analyzed how successful/unsuccessful her theater campaigns were in relation to their launch dates, and how the funding goals affected the playâ€™s campaigns outcomes. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We can see that throughout the year, the number of failed campaigns remains relatively the same within 30-50 campaign range with no extreme spikes, however within the winter months we tend to see not as many failed campaigns. 

There is, however, a drastic spike of succesful campaigns within the summer months indicating that this is the best time to launch new campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We can see that there is a higher percentage of successful campaigns with lower goal amounts with a few exceptions, these should be inventigated further to find out what other factors may be influencing the campaign's success.

## Results

* The best month to launch a campaign with a successful outcome is May.
* Louise should avoid launching new campaigns in January and December.
* The more successful play campaigns' are those with a goal of $1,000 or less.
